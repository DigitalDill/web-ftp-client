# Brains Web FTP Client
A web based FTP client. Like really simple, kind of, filezilla, but for your browser. The main goal of this tool is: Install on a server/NAS/synology/raspberry/desktop and use it like a desktop tool. It can be installed on almost every device, including your server for example. Everything that can run `nodejs` can also run this client. I've mainly built this to run on my NAS because i just want to download huge data from a FTP to my NAS directly, without struggling with the command line.
