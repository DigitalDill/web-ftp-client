# Brains Web FTP Client
A web based FTP client. Like filezilla but for your browser. The main goal of this tool is: Install on a server/NAS/synology/raspberry/desktop and use it like a desktop tool. It is really similar to filezilla but can be installed on almost every device, including your server for example. I've mainly built this to run on my NAS because i just want to download huge data from a FTP to my NAS directly, without struggling with the command line.
